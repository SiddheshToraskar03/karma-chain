KarmaChain — Dharma Justification

KarmaChain models merit accumulation in a way that mirrors classical dharmic systems while remaining practical for modern educational platforms. In classical texts (e.g., the Bhagavad Gita and Mimamsa), actions (karma) are mapped to outcomes based on intent (bhāva) and quality — not merely the act itself. KarmaChain adopts that philosophy:

Action → Intent: Every recorded action has an explicit intent (learning, assisting, service). Intent is used to route rewards to the right token (knowledge vs. seva vs. punya).

Merit layering: Like ancient merit accounts where certain rituals yield long-lasting punya, KarmaChain uses token types with distinct rarity and decay (PunyaTokens for rare, high-value acts; DharmaPoints for routine learning).

Time & decay: Traditional dharmic rewards often lose potency over time unless reinforced by continuous righteous action. Token expiry and controlled decay mirror this principle — encouraging consistent practice rather than one-off achievements.

Role & responsibility: Progression from learner to guru is not merely status; it implies increasing responsibility and expected behavior. The system’s thresholds emulate ashrama-like advancement — higher tiers unlock mentorship duties and privileges.

Q-learning: Reinforcement learning suggests actions that historically promote long-term engagement and positive community impact. This respects the dharmic emphasis on sustained practice and progressive self-transformation.

Ethical & contextual alignment: The design encourages community service (seva), knowledge sharing (dharma), and rare, high-impact acts (punya), offering modern incentives for timeless values.
