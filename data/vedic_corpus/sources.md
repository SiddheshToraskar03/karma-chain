## Categorization Rationale

The classification of actions into Paap severity levels (minor, medium, maha) is based on:

1. **Impact on Others**: Actions that cause greater harm to others receive higher severity classifications
2. **Intention**: Actions performed with malicious intent are classified more severely
3. **Scriptural Emphasis**: The emphasis placed on the prohibition in the scriptures
4. **Traditional Understanding**: How these actions have been traditionally understood in Dharmic traditions
